# Availability Checker

To achieve the functionality of returning real-time availability of professionals and updating based on current activity or schedule, the following steps and best practices should be implemented using the selected tech stack: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. 

1. **System Design:** Create a microservice architecture where the scheduling logic resides in one service that communicates with other services (e.g., user management, calendar service) through RESTful APIs or message brokers. This separation of concerns enhances scalability and maintainability.

2. **FastAPI Implementation:** Use FastAPI to handle incoming HTTP requests related to scheduling. FastAPI's async capabilities allow for efficient real-time processing of requests, making it well-suited for operations that require immediate feedback on professionals' availability.

3. **Real-time Communication:** Implement WebSocket in FastAPI for real-time communication between the client and server. This is crucial for notifying clients about immediate changes in professionals' availability.

4. **Database Management with Prisma:** Utilize PostgreSQL for storing professionals' schedules and availability. Prisma serves as the ORM, simplifying database transactions and ensuring efficient, asynchronous access to data. The `PrismaClient` allows for easy querying and real-time updates.

5. **Scheduling Logic:** Develop a robust scheduling algorithm that considers professionals' current activities, preferences, and time-offs. This algorithm should dynamically update availability as appointments are booked or cancelled.

6. **User Interfaces:** Create user-friendly interfaces for professionals to manage their schedules and availability. Similarly, clients should have an intuitive interface to view real-time availability and book appointments.

7. **Notification System:** Implement a notification system, using FastAPI's BackgroundTasks, to alert professionals and clients of new bookings, cancellations, or changes in the schedule. This enhances the user experience by keeping all parties informed in real-time.

8. **Security and Authentication:** Secure API endpoints using FastAPI's security utilities to ensure that access to professionals' schedules and personal data is restricted to authenticated users only.

9. **Scaling and Optimization:** Monitor system performance and optimize as needed. This includes database indexing, query optimization, and considering a microservices architecture for horizontal scaling.

10. **Documentation and Testing:** Write comprehensive documentation for the API, detailing endpoints, usage, and examples. Implement thorough testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, to ensure reliability and identify issues pre-deployment.

By meticulously following these guidelines and leveraging the power of the chosen tech stack, you can successfully implement a system that accurately reflects real-time availability of professionals, enhancing both operational efficiency and user satisfaction.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'Availability Checker'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
